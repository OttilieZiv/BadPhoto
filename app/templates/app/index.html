        <h2>Terrible Photos</h2>
        <p>
            I've been taking quite frankly dreadful photographs for over twenty years now. The tech has got a lot better, but it hasn't really helped.
            Still want to inflict this stuff on your long-suffering eyeballs? Go ahead, don't say I didn't warn you.

        <h2>Awful Books</h2>
        <p>
            Are you a glutton for punishment? Here are some hideous pictures collected together with some even worse graphic design! And sometimes some words!
